Our core values include:

- Creation of value through information systems

> Indicator Dash is a crypto analytics service designed to help you “do your own research”. It aggregates coin news and tweets, offering indicator signals for measuring buy/sell intensity, or for personalizing pair rankings, along with a crypto knowledge graph and search engine.

Indicator Dash is a crypto analytics product where we provide normalized signals, ready to be combined by the user in a personalized manner to support learning or decision-making through rankings.

We provide a middle ground between raw indicators and algorithmic trading bots. Here, users only need to understand what the indicator represents, but the interpretation process is already done, in the backstage, by Indicator Dash, resulting in specific signals extracted from multiple indicator statistics or configurations. This enables regular users to create custom pair ranking solutions, at the distance of a click, without the need to learn about algorithmic trading and implement their own script. Of course, this comes the cost: only indicator interpretations implemented by us are supported, but we do plan to keep on expanding our indicator signals!

We also collect, categorize, classify, and index crypto news articles, extracting and organizing entities into a knowledge graph. All this content is available through our search engines, or through beautiful ego network visualizations, that let you explore crypto contexts, to learn about new actors in the field and discover new coins.
